## Idea

The idea of the project is to devsing a metric for measuring semantic similarity between words, sentences and ultimately documents. There are many approaches to this NLP problem- finding out word frequency matrix and applying SVM, reducing the dimensions and finally applying Latent Semantic Analysis to find cosines of row vectors hence measuring the similarity. Our approach is of a corpus-based modeling technique that uses Second Order Co-occurence Pointwise Mutual Information along side certain syntactic similarity measures to measure the overall semantic similarity between two sentences.
